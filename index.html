                    <p class="event-text__body hidden1">(commonly referred to as Wanderland Music and Arts Festival), Wanderland was founded in 2013 by Karpos Multimedia Inc. Their vision is to make Filipino people experience a one of a kind music festival and make Wanderland, the biggest and the most established music festival in the Philippines. It also has a pre-event called Wanderband, it is Wanderland's annual battle of the local independent bands. The winner and runner-up are given the chance to play live at Wanderland Music and Arts Festival Since 2017, Wanderland launched a similar annual battle for live visual artists. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, organizers announced on March 4, 2020, that the music festival would be indefinitely postponed in accordance with quarantine but they are making a comeback next year, on march 2023.

                    <p class="event-text__body hidden1">A new musical about Filipinos working abroad is staged at the Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo in CCP. Bayan Bayanan: Letters from Home is set in Europe, told through the perspective of a Filipino scholar sent to Geneva for further studies but is enamored with France and falls for a French girl. It will also tell stories of other Filipinos and their experience building a "community of home" wherever they are. The portrayal of different kinds of Filipinos abroad is initially refreshing, giving the audience a glimpse into a more diverse range of experiences as opposed to the usual portrayal of the diaspora as a mass of miserable, mistreated, underpaid, and overworked domestic workers or caregivers, all struggling to make ends meet while dealing with discrimination and fear of capture. It’s a treat to show that Filipinos are not always poor, that they can afford certain luxuries of life and their hard work can sometimes pay off. But it’s in this level of privilege that the play’s greatest flaws are exposed.

                    <p class="event-text__body hidden1">Based on the biblical story of Jacob's son Joseph, "Joseph the Dreamer" was one of the musicals that finished its full run in Manila before the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. It was also set to be staged in Cebu in May of that year but was no longer pushed through due to lockdown restrictions. The musical by Trumpets is now back for a restaging, again featuring Sam Concepcion in the lead role. Gary Valenciano, who once played the titular role in 1999, returns to the stage this year now as Jacob. Joseph the Dreamer is an imaginative immersion into the journey of a fascinating character, replete with both substance and spectacle, from the strong emotional beats to the moving music and creative choreography. The timeless tale is given new life by a production that deftly balances modernization with the presentation of familiar themes and characters. As a well-known Biblical story, Joseph could have suffered from the audience’s familiarity with the source material so it was paramount for the company to find a fresh take on the story and this production has largely succeeded in this endeavor. The show has all the hallmarks of memorable musical theater from catchy musical numbers, inventive choreography and production design, distinctive characters, and a gripping story.

They have brought traditions into the new age with their theme of Continuing Legacies. This year, ManilART2022 continues forward Forging Futures.

            <p class="event-text__body hidden">The fact that there will never be a perfect price for performing and visual arts is one of the big challenges for their promotion. One of the most contentious issues in all of arts and entertainment is pricing, and it always will be. Price too low and you leave money on the table; price too much and you are considered "arrogant." If you don't make enough money, your funded programs that contribute to sustaining demand will certainly suffer. This has made it difficult to fill up venues. Marketing is a serious problem since performing arts marketing is often situational; what can you do if you don't receive positive reviews? Maintaining a challenging, rewarding, and profitable program to draw new customers and keep current ones engaged is more difficult. It's more difficult than ever to run a successful arts organization, especially if you live in a market where the arts haven't traditionally been as popular as in other places.<br>
            <br>
            Keeping up with talent is the two-edged challenge every artist experiences. However, talent or skills never vanishes and never fades away, but it needs continuous practice. There can be different levels of your talent, and if you reached an advanced level and stopped practicing you might find yourself back to being a beginner all over again. Also, that would be a nightmare to any person, because every single improvement counts, big time. So, keep on practicing, you amazing artists and believe that your talent has no limits.Usually of course, ambitiousness is a quality we should strive for but it can also lead us to set unrealistic goals for ourselves- a frequent cause of work-related stress. Finding balance between focusing on what your organization actually does as well as promoting it is difficult to do but it isn’t impossible. A strong brand identity should be something you invest in. This is a word often thrown about, its definition being ‘of undisputed origin and not a copy; genuine.’ It’s highly likely that you work in the arts because you are passionate about them. Transfer this passion into your marketing. Be authentic when you choose how best to get your message out. Don’t be afraid to be creative and try something new! Think about how you personally engage with online marketing- has a particular organization posted content you have enjoyed? If so, think about why you tapped that ‘like’ button. Did it make you laugh? Did it start a conversation? Or was it just a great photo?</p>
            <div class="editorial__banner hidden"></div>
            <p class="event-text__body hidden">
            The arts have always stood for beauty, a connection to others, prosperity, creativity, and the ability to express oneself. Arts may provide beauty to a space, strengthen community identities, and challenge the status quo through arousing the senses, emotions, and thoughts. With all these alternatives, it is also possible to integrate the arts' creativity and teamwork into the free market economy to generate employment and profit. How do producers, distributors, buyers, and private and governmental support networks interact in this so-called creative economy? What functions do individuals, businesses, organizations, and the government have?<br>
            <br>
            All in all, the major goal of the legislation is to evaluate the situation and coordinate the efforts of all pertinent government organizations in order to support and safeguard the diversity of cultural expressions in the digital sphere. The measure also aspires to connect culture and creative industries through institutions, policies, and rules that support cultural expressions while safeguarding copyrights. Similar to the rest of the world, the Philippines' development of information and communication technology (ICT) has led to the emergence of a new concept of new media, which has had an impact on how cultural goods are produced and disseminated as well as how the diversity of cultural expressions interact.

                    <p class="event-text__body">Arete is a big believer in making art, making noise, and making a ripple in the world. Through that expression, we communicate by drawing on our own unique emotions, thoughts, and experiences. When you see and study another's art, you're seeing the world through their eyes. When you create, you're letting the world see through yours. Even if your work/performance is never displayed in art galleries, stages, exhibits, or museums, personal expression holds many benefits. Creating an artistic piece is relaxing and fulfilling for many artists and helps them cope with the pressures of everyday life or extreme situations. In many ways, making stuff is the opposite of mental distress. Often, when we're feeling bad, we turn away from our inner selves. We close up shop. But making stuff it's about listening to yourself, hearing a part of yourself, and transforming it into something external. Something for others to enjoy. Something that now exists apart from yourself. Something that proves: hey, I am here. I am alive. I matter. I made a thing. <br><br>
                    That’s why we at Arete are tasked with improving the lives of the younger generation. What better way to do this than by helping them to develop a love of the arts? Art in all its forms whether through theater, music, sculpture, or painting is something that should be cherished and appreciated by everyone young and old, and developing this passion for the arts begins in you. It’s a key part for us to promote a deeper understanding of the arts so that the younger generation becomes more self-aware and self-confident, begins to broaden their horizons, and develops a wider range of skills and abilities.
                    <br><br>
                    We think this stuff is important. We know it will inspire people, especially the younger generation. We know it will help other people who might be at the very tentative stages of channeling their emotions into art or music, to create something of their own.
